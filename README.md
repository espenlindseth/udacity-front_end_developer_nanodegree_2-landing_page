# Landing Page Project

## What is this?

This is a project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. The basic idea is to take a simple site that they've provided, and build navigation with ES6 JavaScript.

The first two commits contains the example code, any subsequent commits thereafter will contain my work to deliver on the Project Rubric.

## Udacity's suggestions to make the project stand out

I have implemented the first one so far.

* Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
* Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
* Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
* Update/change the design/content.
* Make sections collapsible.
